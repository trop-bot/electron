# Electron App Feedback Program
The App Feedback Program is for large-scale Electron apps to report app-specific bugs, blockers, and feature requests to the Electron team. There is an #app-feedback-program Slack channel for apps to collaborate together in. Electron is working on building a streamlined release process and having faster releases. If you would like to participate, please send us a message at info@electronjs.org.

## Who Can Join?
This is a new program for Electron and a work in progress. Please bear with us as we refine our process. Our initial criteria and expectations for joining this program include the following items:
- Test your app during the beta period for 10,000+ user-hours. For example, 10 user-hours could be 10 people testing for one hour, or one person testing for 10 hours.
- Have a single point-person to speak for the app (e.g., report Electron bugs and blockers) and check-in weekly, either during our regularly scheduled meeting, or asynchronously with @sofianguy
- Your app should run for 10,000+ user-hours during the beta cycle. We are looking to release stable versions every 2-3 months. For example, you can test 5,000 user-hours on 3.0.0-beta2 and then 5,000 user-hours on 3.0.0-beta5. More is better, but we understand some applications cannot test every beta release.
- You are willing to share criteria listed in the next question.

## What Info Does My Electron App Have To Share?
- Total user-hours your app has been running with any beta release. CI or QA hours do not count towards the total, however internal releases do count.
- Version of Electron that your app is testing with (e.g., 3.0.0-beta3)
- Any bugs preventing your application from upgrading to the release line being beta tested

## Why Should My Electron App Join?
Your app's bugs will be prioritized on the core Electron team's radar. In return, this is helpful for Electron to see how it is doing and what work needs to be prioritized.

## Will My Application's Info Be Shared Publicly? Who Gets To See This Info?
No, your application's information will not be shared with the general public. However, it will be viewable by all members of the `maintainers` team within the [Electron](https://github.com/electron) organization. As of September 2018, there are 200 members in this team.
